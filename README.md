Photo-recognition in Jupyter Notebook

# Description
This notebook contains a Python script for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as real or fake. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the dataset is downloaded from a Google Drive link.

# Used libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

# Notes:
The script assumes that the dataset is structured in a specific way, with training and validation images in separate folders and corresponding CSV files.
The model's performance may vary depending on the dataset and training parameters.
The script includes comments and print statements to help understand the code and debug any issues.
